Next steps:
  - Get container status
  - Document actions
  - Make responses consistent
  - Streaming responses. I am thinking this is done best by letting commands return a command id, that identifies a log file that can be requested seperately. The interface can be a simple interface that can tail log files and stream them line by line.
